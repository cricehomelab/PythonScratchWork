# PythonScratchWork
Independent musing and trying to figure out different things that I'm interested in for python. 

This is mostly just things that strike my fancy, but aren't in an official course. This is sort of just a space for me to try and create small things that aren't really
worthy of a full repository quite yet, but I am trying to grow out.
